# Luvotels - Full-stack hiring test
## Foreword
This is my solution to the Luvotels full-stack practical test.

## User journey
  * The motel owner needs to be able to login and see his/her reports.
  * The reports must contain:
    * bookings
    * total earnings and other stats

## Database
The challenge provided a basic API for the motels, rooms and bookings. I decided to add the motels and rooms to a database for better performance and less API calls. These models are relatively static and donâ€™t need to be updated that regularly.

These models were added in the seed, but in further development it would make sense to implement a background job to sync the database with the API at a certain interval.

For the bookings I decided to use Active Resource because this content is more dynamic and needs to be constantly updated. To limit the number of calls to the API I added low level caching in the controller.

## Users
One of the prerequisites of the challenge was to have an user login in order to see only the reports for his/her motel(s). For the purpose I created three users and made them each the owner of one of the three provided motels.

For testing the app, these are the logins:

user 1: janelle_sipes@haag.info
user 2: kaycee@mayert.co
user 3: andy.kaulke@willhayes.io

password: luvcode6

## Design
For the design I tried to follow the style of the Luvotels site as much as possible. I used the same color palette and font.

To speed up the development I used a few Le Wagon UI components, like the navigation bar and also the list items.

## Things to improve
  * Add pagination to the booking list.
  * Add filtering so that the user can view the bookings for a specific room or date range.
  * Make it possible for one user to have multiple motels.

## Deployment
The app was deployed to Heroku at this address:
